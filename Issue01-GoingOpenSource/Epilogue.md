## So uhmmm... yeah...

This concludes Issue 01 of the Devmonologue magazine. And as every other good school presentation, it ends with "So... yeah...". If you are reading this, I will assume you find these articles enterntaining and/or useful. I really had fun making it and I hope I can continue with many more issues to come. Of course, to justify that, your support will really help. So, any feedback is welcome. If you liked the magazine, found an error, have ideas for topics and resources, feel free to contact me (you can find contact information below). Send me a message, tweet email, picture, reaction gif... whatever.

## Is "Going Open source" open source

In the spirit of this issue's topic - Going Open Source, the entire magazine is, and probably always will be [available in GitHub][DevMonologue magazine GitHub]. And in the spirit of everything we discussed in "Open Source licenses", the magazine uses... none of the mentioned options. It is subject to the [Creative Commons license][Creative Commons license website]. Creative Commons is a license that is popular for art, pictures and articles. For instance, Wikipedia uses Creative Commons to license all contributions that are uploaded to the platform. However, it is not really suitable for code, which is why it was never featured in "Open Source licenses".

## Want to get involved?

Again, in the spirit of "Going open source", I need to leverage the power of the community in order to <strikeout>monetarize</strikeout> improve the magazine.

No, really, as it turns out, creating an even small magazine issue is a **lot** of work. So it would be really great and a lot of fun to actually collaborate with you guys. If you have a dream of trying out your writing skills or have an awesome idea for an issue, drop me a line. I'd love to hear your ideas. Especially if you have experience with graphic design and/or technical writing since these are probably two of my many weaknesses.

In "iOS/Mac open source world" we already discussed how good open source projects have a good README file containing a "Contributions" section. That way, people know how they can collaborate and get involved with the product. So, in order to put my money where my mouth is, I'm going to also add such section to the README of the [DevMonologue repository][DevMonologue magazine GitHub].

What you will find in that section is how you can get involved as a co-author (spoiler alert: write me a message or email). And also since we are programmers, pull requests are more than welcome. I'm sure there are loads of typos and error that are making you pull your hair, so... fix them yourself and file a pull request, you lazy man.
